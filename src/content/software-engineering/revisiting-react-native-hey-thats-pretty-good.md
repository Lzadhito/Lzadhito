## My Initial Experience with React Native

Back in 2020, my journey with React Native started off on a bit of a sour note, particularly when it came to using Expo. The application seemed slow and sluggish, with unexpected issues cropping up at every turn. I was constantly tweaking and adjusting to get native APIs to run, which was neither efficient nor practical. The limitations set by Expo were especially frustrating as they barred access to many native features that were critical for my projects. This restrictive and cumbersome experience led to a growing dissatisfaction with the platform.

## The Flutter 2 Release

In contrast, the release of Flutter 2 in 2022 was nothing short of revolutionary for the hybrid mobile community. Flutter showcased superior capabilities in terms of app performance, app size, and UI development compared to React Native. The apps ran faster, were smaller in size, and the process of UI development was expedited. This compelling comparison led me to a decisive point - I opted out of React Native and removed it from all my mobile app decision-making processes.

## A Forced Revisit to React Native

However, life had a different plan. By 2023, my company was faced with a challenging task - to rewrite a Kotlin app within a tight deadline of just three months. The responsibility fell on our frontend developers, whose expertise was primarily in React JS. With no other viable option, it was time to revisit React Native and Expo, the platforms I'd set aside.

## A Different League: React Native & Expo in 2023

As I delved back into React Native and Expo, I was taken aback by the transformation they had undergone:

1. **Expo's Independence**: Expo had evolved and could now run Android and iOS apps without the necessity of the devices being connected to my PC. This was a significant stride towards flexibility and ease of use.
2. **No More MacBook Dependency**: Another surprising improvement was that I could run iOS apps without needing a MacBook. This removed a major hardware constraint and opened up more opportunities for developers.
3. **Expo Router Revolution**: The introduction of the Expo Router was a game-changer. It was time to bid adieu to stacks and welcome the era of URL routing. This streamlined the process and made navigation within the app a breeze.
4. **Expanded Native API Support**: Expo had broadened its horizons and now supported all native APIs, thereby eliminating the earlier restrictions that I had encountered. This unlocked a new realm of possibilities for app development.
5. **Speed Boost**: App performance had noticeably improved. The apps ran faster, which I believe was largely due to the integration of Hermes, a JavaScript engine optimized for running React Native.
6. **Library Availability**: Despite a few libraries being dead or discontinued, React Native offered a wide array of libraries. This ensured that developers had the tools they needed to create feature-rich apps.
7. **Stronger Community**: Last but not least, the community had grown stronger. Software Mansion recording all the React Native related conferences was a testament to the platform's increasing popularity and the robust support network available.

## Conclusion: Embracing React Native

In conclusion, my journey has come full circle. I now have a newfound respect for React Native. Considering that I use React on a daily basis (and Solid JS for my side projects), I've found React Native to be a comprehensive platform. It's designed to be coded using a web development mental model. This approach allows me to focus more on product development, shifting my attention away from the intricacies of the code. Consequently, React Native has earned its place as my platform of choice for future mobile projects.
