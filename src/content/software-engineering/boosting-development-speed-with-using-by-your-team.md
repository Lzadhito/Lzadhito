## We Never Expect Loosing Android Engineers

In my professional journey, I've come to learn that the choice of technology stack significantly affects a team's capability to develop and maintain a product. Our team initially programmed in native Kotlin for Android applications and used React for web development. However, as our business requirements evolved and the size of our team of Android engineers being cut, we found maintaining our native Kotlin code increasingly challenging.

Our application, while relatively small, was driven by complex business logic. This complexity posed a significant challenge for engineers not familiar with Kotlin, as our remaining team was primarily focused on Go/Elixir backend and ReactJS frontend. The intricacies of the business logic were difficult for non-Kotlin engineers to decipher, which hampered efficiency and productivity.

## Transitioning to React Native

To overcome these challenges, I proposed to my manager that we transition from Kotlin to React Native + Expo + RN Paper. The decision made to use Expo is to have similar developer experience when developing web, and RN Paper to match previous system design using Material UI 2. This shift in our technological approach resulted in several significant benefits.

### Increased Contribution from Frontend Developers

The transition to React Native opened up the opportunity for our frontend developers to contribute to the project. This increased participation not only improved team morale but also led to more diverse input and quicker problem-solving.

### Improved Development Speed

The shift to React Native resulted in a 70% improvement in development speed. This was mainly due to our frontend developers' familiarity with the language. By utilizing a language that our team was comfortable with, we were able to streamline our development process significantly.

### Enabling iOS Application Development

An added advantage of the transition was that it enabled us to develop an iOS application alongside our Android application. This allowed us to expand our reach and cater to a more diverse user base.

## The Conclusion: Embracing Familiar Technology

These benefits underscore the point that employing a technology stack that may not be 'ideal' can often be the more pragmatic decision for a company, particularly when considering cost efficiency and team dynamics. It's crucial to note that this approach may not be a one-size-fits-all solution. But, in the absence of specific requirements preventing the use of familiar technology, it may often be the best option to consider. The experience reaffirmed my belief in the importance of aligning technology choices with the team's skills and the business's strategic needs.
